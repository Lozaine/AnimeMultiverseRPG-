Let’s build a **Phase 1 Quest Pool** you can use straight away.
Remember: Phase 1 quests = **universal, simple, faction-neutral**, focused on introducing mechanics (gain XP, earn a little coin, maybe get food/items).

✅ These are:

* **Quick, low-stakes quests** to teach players the loop.
* **Equal for all factions** → no advantage.
* **Reward pool** = XP + coins + basic consumables (food/healing items).

---

Since Phase 1 is about **learning mechanics** and **keeping factions equal**, rewards should be **small, consistent, and simple** (XP + coins + maybe basic consumables).

# 📊 Phase 1 Reward Scaling Table

| **Quest Type**        | **Examples**                                    | **XP Reward** | **Coin Reward** | **Item Chance**                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Easy Tasks**        | Water Carrier, Street Cleanup, Letter Delivery  | 5–8 XP        | 5–15 coins      | 10% chance (basic food: rice ball, bread)               |
| **Gathering Quests**  | Fishing Trip, Herbal Collection, Wood Gathering | 8–12 XP       | 10–20 coins     | 25% chance (herbs, fish, vegetables)                    |
| **Training Quests**   | Sparring, Endurance Run, Meditation             | 10–12 XP      | 0–10 coins      | 15% chance (stamina potion, focus talisman)             |
| **Hunting Quests**    | Wild Boar Hunt, Wolf Pack Trouble, Bat Cave     | 12–18 XP      | 15–25 coins     | 35% chance (meat, hide, claw — low-tier materials)      |
| **Errand/Community**  | Supply Run, Repair Work, Festival Prep          | 8–12 XP       | 15–20 coins     | 20% chance (small consumable item, e.g. lantern, charm) |
| **Escort/Protection** | Guard Duty, Delivery Protection                 | 15–20 XP      | 20–30 coins     | 30% chance (extra coin pouch or common buff item)       |

## 🎁 Item Pool (Phase 1 Basic Consumables)

* 🍙 **Food Items** → Restore small HP (Onigiri, bread, fish).
* 🌿 **Healing Herbs** → Restore small HP/MP mix.
* 🪵 **Crafting Basics** → Wood, ore, hide (future crafting use).
* 🔮 **Minor Charms** → +5 temporary buff (Attack/Defense/HP) for next quest only.

---

## ⚖️ Why This Scaling Works

* **Easy tasks** (5–8 XP, low coin) → spam-friendly, teaching quests.
* **Hunting/Protection** (15–20 XP, better coin, item chance) → slightly harder but more rewarding.
* **Consumables** help encourage repeat runs (healing needed to keep questing).
* **Items** are mostly “future proof” (Phase 1 = collect, Phase 2+ = use in crafting/shop).

**Player runs:**
`/quest start`

## 🚀 Gameplay Flow in Phase 1

1. Player types `/quest start`.
2. Bot randomly selects a **Phase 1 quest** from the pool.
3. Quest runs instantly → no combat yet, just flavor text + reward.
4. Bot updates player profile (XP, coins, items) in SQLite.
5. Embed shows quest + results → player sees progress clearly.
